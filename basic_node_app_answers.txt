Question 1: What is a Node module?

A.

Modules are building blocks or sets of functionality that are included in a given application. Every file in a node application 
is considered a module. The variables and functions within the modules are scoped to that file; they are private. If we want to use a private
variable or function, we need to explicitly make it public.

Question 2: What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

A.

The exports object is just a reference to module.exports. module.exports is an empty object by default. As it is an empty object, we can add methods
and variables to it directly.

In other words: module.exports is the object that is actually returned as the result of a require call. Modules use exports to make things available. 
The exports variable is initially set to that same object.

Question 3: Why is using exports recommended?

A.

Because module.exports can be reassigned to anything outside of the module, which could lead to bugs and issues. In contrast, any reassignment of 
exports will not be available outside of the module.
